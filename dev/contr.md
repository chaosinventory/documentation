# Contributing

All contributions must be made via a Pull Request to the main GitHub-Repo.

For a pull request to get merged, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- all applicable pipelines must succeed
- at least two approvals must be made for the patch to be merged after 24 hours, or at least four approvals must be made to merge the patch immediately
- the PR must neither be controversial or blocked (indicated by tags)

The Documentation may be also expanded using pull requests. For the documentation repository, two approvals are enough for immediate merge.

Usually, commits from a single PR are squashed and merged.

PRs need to have a meaningful name, and, if applicable, description.
