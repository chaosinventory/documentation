# Contributing

All contributions must be made via a Pull Request to the main GitHub-Repo.

For a pull request to get merged, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- all applicable pipelines must succeed
- at least two approvals must are needed for the patch to be merged after 24 hours, or at least four approvals  to merge the patch immediately
- the PR must neither be controversial or blocked (indicated by tags)

**Fundamental changes, like changes in the database scheme or other disputed areas, require at least four reviews. Those changes should be discussed in a development meeting. A "Fundamental"-Tag should indicate those changes.**

The Documentation may be also expanded using pull requests. For the documentation repository, two approvals are enough for immediate merge.

Usually, commits from a single PR are squashed and merged.

PRs need to have a meaningful name, and, if applicable, a description.
