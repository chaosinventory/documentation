# Contributing

All contributions must be made via a Pull Request to the main GitHub-Repository.

For a pull request to get merged, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- all applicable pipelines must succeed
- merging has to be done by a different person than the one submitting the patch
- it must not be merged until 48h after submission
- at least two approvals are needed to merge the patch immediately
- the PR must neither be controversial or blocked (indicated by tags)

**Fundamental changes, like changes in the database scheme or other disputed areas, require at least four reviews. Those changes should be discussed in a development meeting. A "Fundamental"-Tag should indicate those changes.**

The Documentation may be also expanded using pull requests (PRs). Pull requests need need to follow a few guidelines:

- A PR may be merged immediately with a minimum of only two approvals.
- Multiple commits should be squashed before or during merging, except where it would impact comprehensibility.
- PRs require a meaningful title and, if needed to explain the changes or the rational behind them, a proper description.
